# CoST Brand Guide

> **Decision In Plain Language**  
> Build quiet, functional clarity. Limit colour. Prioritise contrast and evidence. Use generous space, simple shapes, and crisp labels so anyone can read and act.

## Principles To Design By

- **Reduce to the essential:** Remove elements that do not change a decision.  
- **Function over flourish:** Beauty emerges from clarity, not decoration.  
- **Honest materials:** Flat colour, clean type, readable charts. No faux effects.  
- **Invisible complexity:** The system can be sophisticated; the surface stays simple.  
- **Human scale:** Comfortable reading sizes, short lines, obvious interactions.  
- **Consistency:** One palette, one rhythm, one typographic hierarchy.

## Outputs and Use Cases

**What CoST makes, and the patterns each output requires.**

### Public dashboards and portals
*(OC4IDS disclosure, procurement/project explorer, red‑flags, completeness index)*  
- **Primary actions:** filter, search, download CSV, view methodology.  
- **Layout:** 12‑column grid; KPI strip → filters → charts/maps → table.  
- **Patterns:** small multiples for comparisons; direct‑labelled charts; sticky context (scope, unit, date).  
- **Colour:** neutrals by default; Teal for secondary series; Yellow for active execution; single Red callout for critical insight.

### Reports and briefs
*(assurance, quarterly/annual, policy notes)*  
- **Structure:** cover → contents → sections with dividers → methods → annexes.  
- **Patterns:** figure + caption + source; callout boxes for key numbers; endnotes for citations.  
- **Colour:** monochrome with one accent; charts follow the data‑viz spec.

### Presentations and training decks
*(MSG, donor, workshops)*  
- **Master layouts:** title, section divider, content, quote, comparison (2‑col), photo.  
- **Patterns:** one idea per slide; bar/line/small multiples only; large numbers with source.

### Web articles and micrographics
- **Sizes:** 1200×627 and 1080×1080.  
- **Patterns:** problem → key number → anchor comparison → punchline; link to data source.

### What we do not produce
We do not author bid/contract documents. CoST provides guidance and explains standards; procurement documents remain the procuring entity’s responsibility.

## Core Palette

**Primary (binding across products, reports, and portals)**  
- **Deep Red `#b7251c`** — brand marks, primary actions, active tab, key highlights.  
  - Text on red: white only; reserve for headings or buttons.

**Neutrals**  
- **Dark Charcoal `#4a4743`** — default text, axes, icons.  
  - Text on charcoal: white only.  
- **Light Gray `#d7d4cf`** — dividers, gridlines at 20–40% opacity; secondary backgrounds.  
- **Off‑white `#f0ede7`** — page background and cards.

**Accents**  
- **Warm Yellow `#f1c03d`** — highlights, warnings, thresholds.  
  - Text on yellow: black only.  
- **Muted Teal Blue `#71b6c9`** — secondary actions, positive emphasis, comparison series.  
  - Text on teal: white only.

**Contrast rules**  
- Meet WCAG AA: body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1; large text (≥18 px regular or 14 px bold) ≥ 3:1.  
- Approved pairings: White on Red/Charcoal/Teal; Black on Light Gray/Off‑white/Yellow.

**Colour discipline**  
- Use ≤ 1 accent per view. Default to neutrals; add colour only to encode meaning.  
- **Hierarchy semantics:** Teal tonal ramp encodes progression; Yellow marks active execution; Deep Red appears once per view for the critical insight.  
- **Restrained palette:** Prefer monochrome neutrals with a single accent. Colour serves hierarchy and meaning, not decoration.

## Typography

- **Primary face:** Inter (open‑source). Fallback: system UI sans.  
- **Body:** 16–18 px, line‑height 1.45–1.6.  
- **Headings:** H1 28–32 px; H2 22–24 px; H3 18–20 px; tighten line‑height to ~1.25.  
- **Numbers:** Tabular lining figures for tables and charts.  
- **Case:** Sentence case for titles and labels.  
- **Accessible scale:** Increase key text 15–30% for phone and projector readability. If someone squints, the design failed.

## Layout And Space

- **Grid:** 12‑column; base unit 8 px.  
- **Whitespace:** Minimum outer padding 24–32 px; card padding 16–24 px.  
- **Radius:** 16 px on cards and inputs; **Shadows:** soft, low elevation only.  
- **Line length:** 60–80 characters for body text.  
- **Background:** White or off‑white only; coloured backgrounds are banned to protect content contrast.  
- **Title spacing:** 8–16 px between title and subtitle; each section 24–32 px top spacing.  
- **Crowding:** If elements feel cramped, remove or move something. Whitespace guides attention.  
- **Precision alignment:** Align to an 8 px grid and baseline rhythm; keep edge gutters consistent.  
- **Hairlines:** 1 px strokes; avoid 2+ px borders unless the element is interactive.  
- **Visual balance:** Mirror margins and distribute weight; the page should feel stable, not top‑ or side‑heavy.  
- **Actions:** One primary action per view; at most one secondary.  
- **Navigation:** Keep patterns consistent; reduce moments where users must stop to figure things out.

## Logo Use

- Keep clear space equal to the height of the “C”.  
- Place on white or off‑white. If over images, use a solid neutral chip.  
- Do not recolour, outline, or add effects.

## Iconography And Imagery

- **Icons:** Line icons, 2 px stroke, rounded joins; single colour (charcoal or white on dark).  
- **Photography:** documentary, unfiltered, high contrast. No staged symbolism.

### Photography Standards

- **Subjects:** Infrastructure in context (roads, bridges, schools, health facilities, water, energy). Shoot an establishing wide, a functional medium, and a detail.  
- **People:** Show genuine use—workers and community. Obtain consent; avoid minors unless with guardian consent. Do not stage PPE or create unsafe situations.  
- **Sensitive locations:** Avoid interiors and close‑ups of critical assets (e.g., substations, control rooms). Remove GPS/EXIF on publish; generalise location in captions if necessary.  
- **Before/after:** Allowed with conditions—same vantage and scale; date both images; state what changed and why it matters.  
- **Composition:** White background for overlays; no coloured washes. High contrast; natural colour.  
- **File hygiene:** sRGB, 300 dpi for print/150 dpi for web; descriptive filenames `country_city_asset_YYYYMMDD.jpg`.

## Voice And Labels

- Inform, do not market. Prefer concrete nouns and verbs. Name numbers.  
- **Titles** state the takeaway. **Captions** include the key value and source.  
- Avoid jargon. Define terms at first use.  
- Microcopy communicates the value of changes (“faster”, “simpler”, “fewer steps”).  
- Confirmations reassure without noise (e.g., “Saved securely”).  
- Plain actions: intent‑revealing labels (e.g., “Download CSV”); avoid cleverness.  
- Keep branding, language, and tone consistent across onboarding, emails, support, and integrations.

### Data quality language

- **Verified:** audited or cross‑checked against primary documents (e.g., contract, change order, payment certificate). Include page/section references.  
- **Reported:** provided by the government buyer/publisher; not independently validated by CoST.  
- **Estimated:** derived from models or partial data; clearly state the method and assumptions.  
- **Incomplete:** key fields missing (e.g., X of Y records absent). Specify which fields and the impact on interpretation.

### Negative findings presentation

- **Cost overruns:** show original budget vs final value with variance % and amount; explain drivers (e.g., change orders, scope growth) and recommended action.  
- **Delays:** plot planned vs actual milestones; annotate slippage; state contractual implications if any.  
- **Red flags:** name the exact standard violated (e.g., “missing ESIA”, “single‑bidder tender”); avoid euphemisms; provide source reference.  
- **Corruption indicators:** present neutrally; cite legal definitions and evidentiary status (allegation, investigation, confirmed).

### Methodology transparency

- Sample size and selection method.  
- Data limitations and gaps (and how they may bias results).  
- Confidence intervals or error bounds where applicable.  
- Who conducted the analysis and review.

### Procurement terminology

| **Term** | **Plain substitute** | **When to use technical term** |
|---|---|---|
| Procuring entity | Government buyer | First reference in document (include formal name) |
| Bill of quantities (BoQ) | List of work and materials | When explaining BoQ structure or legal context |
| Variation order | Change to contract scope | Always define on first use |
| Time overrun | Project running late | Use technical term in tables; explain in text |
| Contract modification value | Extra money added to the contract | Use in methodology and annexes |
| Procurement method | How the buyer chose the winner | Use formal term in tables; plain phrase in narrative |

## Accessibility

- Contrast per WCAG AA minimums; AAA for small grey text when feasible.  
- Do not use colour alone to encode meaning; pair with shape, pattern, or labels.  
- Provide alt text on images and long‑desc links for complex charts.  
- Keyboard focus visible; target size ≥ 40×40 px.  
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles; announce state changes for screen readers when needed.  
- Responsive by default: support phone, tablet, and laptop breakpoints.  
- Graceful fallbacks for low bandwidth or offline: skeletons, cached last good state; defer heavy media.

## Multilingual Support

- **Language coverage:** English plus support for locales using German, Arabic (RTL), Cyrillic, Devanagari.  
- **Text expansion:** For German, allow +10–15% component width or line wrap; avoid fixed‑width buttons.  
- **Right‑to‑left:** Use logical properties (margin‑inline, padding‑inline); flip navigation and layout; keep charts and numbers LTR unless local norms require otherwise; mirror directional icons.  
- **Fonts:** Inter for Latin; add fallbacks: *Noto Sans Arabic*, *Noto Sans Devanagari*, *Noto Sans*, system UI. Ensure tabular numerals in chart labels.  
- **Number formats:** Locale‑aware thousands and decimals; use non‑breaking spaces where appropriate.

## Data Visualisation System

**Purpose:** Make comparisons and change obvious at a glance. Every chart earns its place. Target five‑second scan.

### Colour Semantics
- **Primary series:** Charcoal.  
- **Secondary series:** Teal.  
- **Highlight:** Red (single point or bar) or Yellow for caution.  
- **Contexts:** Background Off‑white; gridlines Light Gray at ~30%.  
- **Progression:** Use a teal tonal ramp (light → deep) to show start → finish.

### Chart Titles And Callouts
- Title states the insight, not the topic.  
- Subtitle gives scope, unit, and time frame.  
- Define acronyms (e.g., OC4IDS) on first use in the subtitle.  
- Callout box near the data point with the key number and % change.

### Axes And Grids
- Axes in charcoal at 70% opacity; ticks minimal.  
- Gridlines only where they help reading; 1 px Light Gray at ~30%.  
- Start at zero for bars. For lines, clearly mark broken axes.

### Series Styling
- Lines 2–3 px; points 4–6 px, hollow by default; area fills at 15–25% opacity.  
- Bars 8–24 px with 30–50% inner gap; rounded corners 2 px.  
- Error bars and ranges supported; label uncertainty.

### Legends And Labels
- Prefer direct labels to separate legends.  
- When legends are required, place top‑left; order matches data order.  
- Values use tabular numerals; abbreviate large numbers (e.g., 2.4M) and include full value in tooltip or footnote.

### Tables
- Left‑align text; right‑align numbers. Zebra rows using Off‑white.  
- One highlight column in Teal for the decision variable.  
- Include data sources and update date.

### Maps
- Monochrome base (Off‑white to Light Gray). Data layer in Teal. Outliers/alerts in Yellow.  
- Borders and coastlines in Light Gray at 40%.  
- Choropleths use ≤ 5 steps; provide a legend with endpoints and units.

### Small Multiples
- Prefer small multiples over overloaded single charts for comparisons.  
- Paced sequences: each panel adds one idea; keep shared axes and scales for fast comparison.

## Infrastructure Data Patterns

- **Budget vs actual comparisons**  
  - Show planned (Teal), actual (Charcoal), and variance as % and amount; highlight variance > 20% in Red.  
  - Include procurement method and contract type in subtitle or footnote.

- **Project timelines**  
  - Gantt‑style: Light Gray = planned; Teal = completed; Yellow = active; Red = overdue.  
  - Mark milestones with dates and procurement stages; no arrows—use aligned bars and markers.

- **Hierarchical breakdowns**  
  - National → sector → project → contract package as treemap or indented table (prefer table for small screens).  
  - Show absolute values and % share; keep depth ≤ 4 levels.

- **Red flag indicators**  
  - Binary flags: Red dot + label; severity scores: Yellow (caution) to Red (critical).  
  - Never show a flag without naming the violated standard and citing source.

## Anti‑Patterns

- No 3D, gradients, drop‑shadowed text, or dual y‑axes unless essential.  
- No decorative arrows or overlapping shapes; if direction is required, use simple numbered rectangles or step bars.

## Motion

- Prefer no motion. When needed, animate value change only (150–200 ms) using opacity/transform.  
- Micro‑interactions confirm actions without stealing attention.  
- Preserve context between states; avoid jarring cuts.  
- Performance: keep animations smooth; use transform/opacity and avoid layout thrash.
